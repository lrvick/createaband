<P>This script is copyright &copy; 1997-2000 by Zoltan Milosevic, All Rights Reserved.  Terms and conditions last updated June 15, 2000.</P>

<P>This script may be downloaded and used for any purpose, including commercial, provided that the Distribution Conditions are met.</P>

<P>This script is commercial software, even though no fee is charged directly. The script is distributed widely, under controlled conditions, in order to build name recognition and traffic for www.xav.com. The greater name recognition and traffic lead to advertising revenue, sales of other products, and sales of CGI customization/installs.</P>

<P>Violating the distribution conditions infringes on the script copyright and damages the underlying business model. Any infringement claim against a violator may include: actual damages to the copyright holder; any profits earned by the violator; and statutory damages up to $100,000, plus court costs and attorney fees.</P>

<P><B>Distribution Conditions:</B></P>

	<OL>

		<LI> <P>The copyright notice and links to www.xav.com must remain in place, though any other changes are permitted. Those who substantially change the script - by, say, adding nice HTML formatting - are free to attach their own copyright to their own value-added work, but their claim would apply only to the value-added work, and would not compete with the original copyright.</P>

		<LI> <P>You may not resale this script or any derived work.</P>

		<LI> <P>You may not re-distribute this script - for example, by placing the original ZIP archive on your download site. To distribute the script, link to www.xav.com.</P>

		<LI> <P>You may not charge for hosting this script as a specific service. For example, you may not charge users $10/month to host and maintain this script. (It is fine if you charge your customers extra for general CGI access, and the customer subsequently has this script installed.  It is also fine to charge install fees or customization fees; the difference is the residual versus one-time nature of payment.)</P>

	</OL>

<P><B>Exceptions:</B></P>

	<OL>

		<LI>

			<P>Many users wish to remove the publicly viewable copyright notice and/or link to www.xav.com. This can be done in return for a one-time payment of $20 to:</P>

			<P><PRE>	Zoltan Milosevic
	4203 University Way NE P166
	Seattle, WA 98105</PRE></P>

			<P>Include the your name, URL, and the name of the script. This purchases a right to remove the publicly-viewable copyright and link; it does not transfer the copyright to you. It does not apply to the internal copyright written at the top of the source code file(s).</P>

		<LI>

			<P>Some users wish to charge their customers a residual fee for hosting this script, and/or host this script with embedded banner ads, or host this script for others as part of some other for-profit venture. This can be done for a standard royalty fee of 25% of hosting profits, but it must be approved in advance.</P>

		<LI>

			<P>Similarly, some users wish to enhance the script and sell it, or include it in a compilation. This is typically approved for a 25% royalty on profits, but again advance approval is required.</P>

		<LI>

			<P>Exceptions are typically granted when the script is used for educational or charitable causes. Users who want such an exception should send an email stating their desired exception and describing their educational/charitable cause.</P>

	</OL>

	<P>In situations where royalties are being paid, the publicly-viewable copyright notice and link to www.xav.com may be removed. The internal copyright written at the top of the source code files must remain intact.</P>

	<P>To establish royalty agreements, request exceptions, or make general inquiries, contact Zoltan Milosevic at <A HREF="mailto:zoltanm@nickname.net">zoltanm@nickname.net</A>.</P>
