<P>Hello there. I am an HTML document with an embedded SSI tag.</P>

<P>You should see the text "Include Test Successful" right there:</P>

<XMP><!--#include file="include.txt" --></XMP>

<P>If you see <TT>&lt;!--#include file="include.txt" --&gt;</TT> instead, then SSI is not enabled for this file extension.</P>
